Gonna start with a Reddit Clone from freeCodeCamp.org, then see if I can make it cooler

This is gonna start out as a clone of reddit using Spring Boot, Java, Javascript, SQL, Angular, yadda yadda yadda
based on [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/DKlTBBuc32c "Spring Boot and Angular Tutorial - Build a Reddit Clone") from [freeCodeCamp.org.](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

I currently have two ideas for what to do with this once it's all done and ready to go.

- Strip it down a bit and give it a new coat of paint, so to speak, so that it kinda emulates old-school BBSes in looks and feel
- Or see if I can somehow squish it down into a PWA that everybody can use

The first option was the idea I had first, but while it is probably a bit easier and suits my tastes better, I feel like more people want the second option.
So I dunno. I'll figure it out as I go along, I suppose. 

...Oh yeah, I should probably treat this as an actual readme file.

### Anyway, actual relevant information goes here

So this is basically a reddit clone, or at least will be once I finish the tutorial, and then only until I figure out what to do with it.
The tech stack should look something like this, arranged roughly from back-end to front-end:

* Java 8
* MySQL
* Spring Boot, Security, and Data JPA
* Angular 9
* Bootstrap 4

If you haven't used or heard of reddit before, it's a kind of social media(?) site where users post content in... discussion board-esque subdivisions of the site called subreddits.
Actually it might be easier to understand if you see for yourself, to be honest. [Here](https://wwww.reddit.com), see for your self.
I'll uh, update this further when there's something relevant to say.
